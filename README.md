# Neural-network-Identifier


This repository contains the code and files for a neural network identifier implemented using Simulink in MATLAB. The purpose of this project is to develop an identification model for a plant using a neural network.
Project Overview

The neural network identifier is designed to analyze the input-output behavior of a plant and learn its underlying dynamics. By training the neural network on a set of input-output data, it can accurately predict the plant's response for unseen inputs.

The main steps involved in the project are as follows:

1-  Dataset Preparation: A dataset comprising input-output pairs for the plant is prepared. This dataset serves as the training data for the neural network.

2-  Neural Network Architecture: The neural network is configured in Simulink, specifying the number of layers, neurons per layer, activation functions, and other relevant parameters.

3-  Training: The neural network is trained using the prepared dataset. The training process involves adjusting the network's weights and biases to minimize the difference between predicted outputs and actual plant responses.

4-  Validation: Once the neural network is trained, it is validated using a separate set of data that was not used during training. This step ensures that the network can generalize well and accurately predict the plant's behavior for unseen inputs.

5-  Identification: The trained neural network can be used as an identifier for the plant. Given a new input, it can provide an estimate of the corresponding output based on the learned patterns from the training data.

**Getting Started**

To get started with the neural network identifier, follow these steps:
1-  Clone the repository to your local machine or download the code files.

2-  Open the Simulink model neural_network_identifier.slx in MATLAB.

3-  Use the provided dataset or replace it with your own input-output data for training and validation.

4-  Run the training script to train the neural network on the training dataset.

5-  Run the validation script to evaluate the performance of the trained neural network on the validation dataset.

6-  Once trained and validated, use the identification script to estimate the plant's output for new inputs.
